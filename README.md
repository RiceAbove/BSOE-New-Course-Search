A website to help fellow banana slugs quickly find new BSOE courses 

## About
Starting Fall 2019, many BSOE (Baskin School Of Engineering) courses at UC Santa Cruz will have changed course numbers and codes. I wanted to make a website that will help students quickly find the courses they need to take. Just simply type in the old course code (e.g. CMPS 101) and it will return the new code (e.g. CSE 101) with the decription of the class.
