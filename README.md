A website to help fellow slugs quickly find the new BSOE new courses 

## About
Starting Fall 2019, many BSOE Courses will have changed course numbers and codes. I wanted to make a website that will help UC Santa Cruz students quickly find the courses they need to take. Just simply type in the old course code and it will return the new one with the decription of the class.
